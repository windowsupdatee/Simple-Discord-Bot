# Simple-Discord-Bot
A simple Discord Bot. Already comes with a commands folder and a ping command.

# About the bot
This bot was made with the Discord.js Guide. It doesn't offer anything special, just a ping command.

# How to get it up and running
Well getting it up and running is actually very easy. First of all make sure you have the latest version of Node installed. After that I recommend to install Visual Studio Code. Make a folder and name it to any name. Open a CMD window and type in "cd (space then drag in the folder from the desktop). After we will run a command that will create a package.json. Type in "npm init -y". Now for the last step in the CMD. Type in "npm install discord.js". This step is very important. Without this step the bot will not work. DO NOT CLOSE THE CMD WINDOW. Now go into Visual Studio Code and go  into File > Open Folder and select the folder that your bot is in. Go and make a file named "index.js" and copy everything from my file. Then make another file named "config.js" and change the "prefix-goes-here" and the "token-goes-here' to your token from the aplication bot. If you haven't done one already use this "https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot". Now go back to the CMD window and type in "node index.js" and your bot should be up and running. Now to test if it works by doing "(prefix from the config file)ping" and it should respond with "Pong.". Good luck!

# Adding commands
Adding commands is actually very easy. Go into the commands folder and make a file named "command-name.js" and in the command paste in the command code. 

# Where to get code for commands
"https://discordjs.guide/" has loads of code for commands and other stuff. You can also search on Google or YouTube for commands but I do not recommend that because of some reasons:
1. From copying and pasting you do not learn anything.
2. The Discord.js Guide actually explains everything in the code.
3. Most Google and YouTube tutorials are outdated or not working.

# Just some other info
This bot was made by Windows Update#4260 on Discord.
This is all free to use. 
I don't need any credits, it doesn't include any of my commands or my code.It only offers a ping command.

# Hope this helps!
