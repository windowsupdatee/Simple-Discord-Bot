# Simple-Discord-Bot
A simple Discord Bot. Already comes with a commands folder and a ping command.

# About the bot
This bot was made with the Discord.js Guide. It doesn't offer anything special, just a ping command.

# Adding commands
Adding commands is actually very easy. Go into the commands folder and make a file named "command-name.js" and in the command paste in the command code. 

# Where to get code for commands
https://discordjs.guide/ has loads of code for commands and other stuff. You can also search on Google or YouTube for commands but I do not recommend that because of some reasons:
1. From copying and pasting you do not learn anything.
2. The Discord.js Guide actually explains everything in the code.
3. Most Google and YouTube tutorials are outdated or not working.

# Just some other info
This bot was made by Windows Update#4260 on Discord.
This is all free to use. 
I don't need any credits, it doesn't include any of my commands or my code.It only offers a ping command.

# Hope this helps!
